# React ToDo List

A simple frontend-only ToDo List App using React and styling with SASS.  
The user is able to add tasks with the following properties:

- Title
- Due date
- Priority

Since there is no backend connected to it, you are free to add todo items to the list, but it will reset to its default state on browser reload.
